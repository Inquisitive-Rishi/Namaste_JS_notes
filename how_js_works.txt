Some big questions:

1. Do you know how JS works?
2. Is JS synchronous or asynchronous?
3. Is JS single threaded or multi threaded?

Everthing in JS happens inside an 'Execution Context'

EC is like a big box where all JS code gets executed.

How this EC actually looks like?

EC has two components:
1. Memory component aka Variable Environment.
2. Code component aka Thread of Execution.


1. VE / MC:

This is the place where all the variables and functions are stored as a key:value pair.
eg: x = 10; as a:10
    function x() {...} func : {...}

    something like this.

2. CC / TOE:

This is the place where code gets executed one line at a time.

So here's an important concept:

- JS is a synchronous single threaded language.

What is synchronous single threaded?

- It means that JS can execute code one command at a time and in a specific order.

- This means JS goes to the next line once the current line has finished executing.
